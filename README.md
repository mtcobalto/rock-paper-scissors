# Rock-paper-scissors
The rock paper scissors game created using Javascript, as a part of The Odin Project curriculum. Pretty straightforward ain't it?

Current version is the second iteration and has a UI now, it is very poor, but it does the job. Once I get better I'll improve it I'm sure.

(The app has a mixture of chilean spanish and english, I'll a language selector eventually)
